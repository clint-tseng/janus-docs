Views and Templaters and Mutators
=================================

&mdash;oh my! No, don't worry. This chapter is long but each of these systems are
quite small, each manages a distinct handful of things, and they fit together
composably and seamlessly. Here is a brief overview of each of them:

* **Mutators** are a lot like what you saw in the [rederiving Janus](/theory/rederiving-janus)
  article. They take some parameters specific to their purpose, then a `(dom, point, immediate)`
  context, and they return an `Observation`, which as you'll recall is a cancellable
  ticket for a Varying reaction.
* **Templates** group multiple Mutators together. They compose by inclusion (we'll
  get to that), which allows easy reusability of little pieces. They also do the
  work of interpreting and executing the selectors targeting each Mutator.
* **Views** take a subject, a DOM fragment, and a template, and each instantiation
  manages the lifecycle of a single view instance. Mostly, this involves providing
  a `point` context for the `from` statements in the template, managing client-side
  event wiring, and properly disposing of resources at the end of a view's life.

We'll go through each one in order, before delving into some topics that combine
knowledge of all three components: child Views, View Models, custom mutators,
custom `_render`, and `view.attach()`.

Mutators
========

Here is an entire mutator, exactly as written in the Janus source:

~~~ noexec
attr = (prop, data) -> (dom, point, immediate = true) ->
  data.all.point(point).react(immediate, (x) -> dom.attr(prop, safe(x)))
~~~

There's really no nonsense; each of the default mutators besides `render` is this
concise. You can easily imagine writing your own for your own needs, and indeed
this is a possibility we will cover. The `safe(x)` call, by the way, just ensures
that the value is coerced to a string.

Let's break down each component here. If it already looks good to you, possibly
because you remember it from earlier, feel free to skip ahead a little.

The first set of arguments are `(prop, data)`. This is meant to mirror jQuery's
own `.attr(prop, value)` call, but here instead of a concrete `value` we expect
to find a `from` expression which results in the value we wish to apply. Remember,
because `from` chains result in `Varyings` and mutators use `.react` as you see
above, this mutation will hold true for all of time. This first set of arguments
are what application code would actually call.

The second set of arguments takes `(dom, point, immediate)`. `dom` is the target
DOM node, and `point` is a function we can use to resolve our `from` expressions.
`immediate` is passed along to our Varying `.react` call, which as you'll recall
governs whether the initial value causes a reaction or not.

The idea here is that the first set of arguments defines the semantics of this
mutation: what are we mutating and what value should we mutate it to? The second
call, then, which is performed by the framework, injects the context relevant
to some particular instance of that mutator: what is the target of our mutations
and where do we get the data from? The result of this mutation operation is an
`Observation` ticket that represents that mutation, and which can be used to
cancel it.

The default mutators are:

* `attr(prop, value)` which sets a node's attribute.
* `prop(prop, value)` which sets a node's attribute.
* `classGroup(prefix, value)` which maintains a node class of `prefix + value`.
  With each new `value`, any classes starting with `prefix` are removed.
* `classed(class, value)` which sets some classname if some condition is true.
* `css(prop, value)` which sets some CSS property.
* `html(value)` which directly sets the html of some node (no XSS protection!).
* `text(value)` which sets the text of some node (XSS-safe).

In each of these, `value` is some `from` expression, and any other parameters
are static values. There are also `render()` and `on()`, but we will talk about
those separately later on.

We won't provide any direct usage examples of mutators just yet, because typically
you _won't_ be using them directly; instead, you'll use the templating interface.

Templates
=========

The templating system consists of two toplevel Janus exports: `template()` and
`find()`. `template()` is a holding box that takes one or more `find()` expressions,
and `find` is a chaining API managing selectors and mutations.

> We are going to look at many examples of using templates, but bear in mind that
> while our template _definitions_ look like they would in typical application
> code, we would normally execute these templates in the context of a `DomView`,
> which we will avoid using until we cover it later.

~~~
const html = $('<div class="target"><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div>');

const nametag = template(
  find('.name')
    .text(from('name'))
    .css('color', from('name').map(x => x.includes('!') ? 'red' : '')),

  find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7))
)(html);

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });

nametag($('.target'), dog.pointer(), true);
~~~
~~~ target-html
<div><div class="target"><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div></div>
~~~

So each `find` call takes a selector within our component html fragment, and then
we can call any of our mutators to run that mutator against that selection target.
In fact, it looks like we can chain on as many mutations as we'd like, just as if
we were using jQuery.

In turn, the `template()` call takes one or more `find` chains, and groups them
together to act in concert.

But in our usage here, we have also tagged on a call `)(html);` which feeds the
template an html fragment. And then, in the last line, when we give the template
that `dom, point, immediate` context triplet, it doesn't look like we're feeding
it that same html fragment, but instead some other html node we are selecting off
the page itself. What gives?

It turns out that template wants its target html fragment twice. Here is the full
function signature of `find` and `template`:

~~~ noexec
find('selector').mutator(â€¦) => (domTemplate) => (domInstance, point, immediate) => Observation
template: (...finds) => (domTemplate) => (domInstance, point, immediate) => [Observation]
~~~

The first time it takes a dom fragment (`domTemplate`), this is a template for it
to learn from.  The templater will take all the selectors you've given it via `find()`,
run them against the template to find matching nodes, and learn those nodes as
walks of the DOM tree. Later, when it needs to actually execute the mutations,
it doesn't have to query the selector against the concrete fragment `domInstance`
every single time, it can just rewalk the tree according to the patterns it already
learned (eg "this selector matched the two children of the first child of the root
node").

This is for two reasons. The first is performance: selectors are slow, prebaked
tree walks are quite fast. The second is accidental capture: eventually, once we
cover the `render()` mutator, we will be able to nest views within each other.
If a view `b` is nested within our current view `a`, and both contain some node
`.name`, it would be unexpected and difficult to manage if a templating statement
`find('.name')` assigned to view `a` also selected the nested node within `b`.
Since our walk method learns its target nodes before nested views are rendered,
this way we know we are only selecting local matches.

The other thing you might notice from the above definitions is that `find` and
`template`, once given their semantic definitions, have exactly the same signatures.
This is intentional, because it lets us treat the two the same in a lot of ways;
most specifically, this trick lets us nest `template`s inside of each other:

~~~
const html = $('<div class="target"><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div>');

const nameFragment = template(
  find('.name')
    .text(from('name'))
    .css('color', from('name').map(x => x.includes('!') ? 'red' : ''))
  // you can imagine more find statements here..
);

const nametag = template(
  nameFragment,
  find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7))
)(html);

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });

nametag($('.target'), dog.pointer(), true);
~~~
~~~ target-html
<div><div class="target"><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div></div>
~~~

You can imagine, then, using `nameFragment` across many different templates that
have a common shared part, without having to separate that part into its own reused
component. You can even consider layering parameters on top of an operation like
this:

~~~
const html = $('<div class="target"><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div>');

const excitedText = (selector, key) => template(
  find(selector)
    .text(from(key))
    .css('color', from(key).map(x => x.includes('!') ? 'red' : '')));

const nametag = template(
  excitedText('.name', 'name'),
  find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7))
)(html);

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });

nametag($('.target'), dog.pointer(), true);
~~~
~~~ target-html
<div><div class="target"><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div></div>
~~~

In fact, for that same reason that `template` and `find` look substantially similar,
you don't even have to wrap the `nameFragment`/`excitedText` snippets in the above
example with a `template` call unless you wish to group multiple `find` expressions
together. And, as we get into full views next, you don't need to bother with `template`
if you only have one `find` statement to bind.

Views
=====

We'll actually spend most of our time here talking about `DomView`s, which are
the species of `View`s that are specific to HTML DOM elements.

Looking at the results from our previous section, we already have a lot of power
by the time we get to `template`s. The syntax is a bit annoying, but in terms
of functionality all we're really missing is client-side interactivity, and some
sort of resource management around all these bindings.

These areas are exactly where DomViews step in.

~~~
const NameTag = DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name')
      .text(from('name'))
      .css('color', from('name').map(x => x.includes('!') ? 'red' : '')),

    find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7))
));

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });
return new NameTag(dog);
~~~

Gone is all the annoying boilerplate! By defining the convention that the given
fragment will be used both as the learning template and then cloned for each
instance of the view, we save ourselves having to manage that process. And by
defining the convention that each View has exactly one `subject`, to which we
anchor our `point` operation, we simplify the view invocation by a lot.

> Focusing each View around a single subject also greatly simplifies the task of
> creating [child views](#child-views), which we will cover below.

Client-side interactivity
-------------------------

Let's take a look at client-side interactivity, then. We already have jQuery,
which is a pretty effective tool for doing this sort of thing, but how does it
fit into the Janus picture?

There are two options. (We're going to simplify the template itself for the next
few examples, since you presumably get that point by now.)

~~~
class NameTag extends DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="age"/><button>older</button></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('name')),
    find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7))
)) {
  _wireEvents() {
    const dom = this.artifact();
    const dog = this.subject;
    dom.find('button').on('click', () => {
      dog.set('age', dog.get('age') + 1);
    });
  }
}

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });
return new NameTag(dog);
~~~

Any instance of `DomView` can implement its `_wireEvents` method, and it will
get called whenever event wiring should occur. `DomView` will automatically wire
events on child views if it itself has been wired, so in a typical Janus application
structure with a single root view hosting all other views you'll only have to
call `.wireEvents()` once, on the root, and only on the client-side (since setting
up client-side interactivity on a server rendering would be pointless).

That's a lot of boilerplate, though, just to wire up a click event. Janus offers
another syntax to accomplish the same thing:

~~~
const NameTag = DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="age"/><button>older</button></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('name')),
    find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7)),

    find('button').on('click', (event, subject) => {
      subject.set('age', subject.get('age') + 1);
    })));

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });
return new NameTag(dog);
~~~

The `.on` mutator is a little different than the others: it doesn't actually do
any databinding or node mutation, it just remembers your event handler. In a little
bit of a dirty trick, it stores it on the `Observation` ticket it creates, and
`DomView` searches all its Observation tickets for these handlers when it wants
to wire up events.

Your callback will be given a longish set of arguments: `(event, subject, view, dom)`.
You can also rely on [`.on('event', 'subselector', callback)` syntax](https://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handler),
which can be really useful for handling events on behalf of children if there are
quite a lot of them and wiring each individually would be a performance concern.

Philosophically, we leave it to you to decide whether to mix this `.on` syntax
in with your actual mutator bindings, or separate them into a block at the end,
or to ignore them altogether and use the `_wireEvents` method.

It's also entirely up to you what each of these handlers does. A variety of styles
are possible, but we do have a suggested style.

Once you get used to solving problems in Janus&mdash;and especially once you get
a hang of describing each problems with the minimum, required essential, state
variables and letting all your other values fall out of them in mapping
computation&mdash;you'll find that almost all your interactivity handlers are
really short&mdash;usually between one and five lines, focused on changing a
single state value or injecting a single piece of truth into the system.

This brevity is nice, because these event handlers are one of the very few spots
in Janus where we don't really bother with the whole song and dance of pure functions
and immutability&mdash;and yet, because they are short manipulations it's still
easy to look at them and convince yourself of their correctness.

View Lifecycle
--------------

Okay, so what about disposing of our Views when we're done with them? We've created
a bunch of databindings that take up memory and processing cycles, and letting
them just run forever would slow us down a lot. Here is your first introduction
to `.destroy()`:

~~~
const NameTag = DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="age"/></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('name')),
    find('.age').text(from('age').map(x => x * 7))));

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot!', age: 4 });
const view = new NameTag(dog);
view.destroy();
return view;
~~~

Fine, so that wasn't very exciting. It turns out that `destroy` is definitive
enough an action that it makes creating any kind of demonstration difficult:

* It halts all bound mutators (by stopping their reactions).
* It emits a `destroying` event on the DOM fragment as an open notification.
* It removes its DOM fragment from the document.
* It stops some internal tracking reactions on child views.
* It repeats the process for any child views.

It's pretty thorough. Importantly, all our reactions are manually and explicitly
freed up, so we know we aren't leaking any resources or computation.

Typically, though, you won't be calling `destroy()` on Views; you can rely on
the `.render` mutator, which handles child views, to do this for you.

Child Views
===========

We delayed talking about this one since `.render` and DomView work together, unlike
the other mutators that are entirely opaque to DomView. To render a child view,
just ask for some subject to be rendered.

~~~
const Dog = Model.build();

const NameTag = DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="child"/></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('name')),
    find('.child').render(from('pup'))));

const app = new App();
app.get('views').register(Dog, NameTag);

const dog = new Dog({
  name: 'Spot',
  pup: new Dog({ name: 'Tot', pup: new Dog({ name: 'Blot' }) })
});
return app.view(dog);
~~~

So&mdash;we also delayed this one because suddenly we have to talk a little bit about
`App` and `Library`. We will [go in-depth with them later](/theory/app-and-applications),
but in short `App` sequesters a lot of the glue code that makes some aspects of
Janus seem to magically work. We are running into one of those gluey bits here.

`App` is where we put a lot of the context that your application needs, like what
views you would like to use to render which objects. The actual registration (that's
the `.register(TargetType, ViewToUser)` call in the sample) and retrieval of these
associations is what `Library` is for, but we never create one here because `App`
comes with one built in, which is what we're pulling up when we call `.get('views')`.
The magical gluey part is that when we ask App to get us a view for some object
(`app.view(dog)` above) it sneakily injects itself as context on the resulting view.

That way, when _that_ view in turn (or, in actuality, the `.render` mutator attached
to that view) is asked to render some child view, all you need to give it is the
thing you'd like rendered, and it just calls `app.view()` to get a new child
view&mdash;and in turn, that new child view _also_ gets a reference to your App
injected into it.

Of course, you may have more than one view representation for each object, or
arguments you want to pass to the created child view. We'll get into these methods
more later, but `.context()`, `.criteria()`, and `.options()` are chaining options
on top of `.render`. We'll demonstrate `.options` here, which passes `options`
bags to child Views.

~~~
const Dog = Model.build();

const NameTag = DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="child"/></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('name')),
    find('.child')
      .render(from('pup').and.self()
          .all.map((pup, view) => (view.options.depth > 1) ? null : pup))
        .options(from.self().map(view => ({ depth: (view.options.depth || 0) + 1 })))
      .classed('has-children', from('pup').map(x => x != null))
  ));

const app = new App();
app.get('views').register(Dog, NameTag);

const dog = new Dog({ name: 'Spot',
  pup: new Dog({ name: 'Tot',
    pup: new Dog({ name: 'Blot',
      pup: new Dog({ name: 'Ought' }) }) }) });
return app.view(dog);
~~~

So we learn two things. In these chained additions to render we can still use
`from` expressions, so we can generate these additional inputs from our data as
usual (though they also happily take static values). And, even with this subchain
that expands on `.render` happening, we can still chain on further mutators without
trouble (as long as the names don't conflict, in which case the subchain is preferred).

> Typically, unless it's a really big performance difference not to draw the
> additional views, we would actually recommend the use of CSS to accomplish
> this sort of task, since it's significantly simpler.

Again, we'll cover the other subchain methods in greater detail once we get to
the [chapter on App and Applications](/theory/app-and-applications), but in terms
of how they can accept `from` expressions and chain, they are the same as you
see here.

> If you want to see some usage now, check out the second example in the
> [View Models](#view-models) section just below.

Behind the scenes, DomView and the render mutator work together to ensure that
`.wireEvents()` is filtered down to subviews when it should be, including when
the subview is swapped out. The render mutator also makes sure any discarded views
are properly disposed of with `destroy`.

Advanced Techniques
===================

Various combinations of everything you've just learned will cover most of your
rendering needs. It's worth covering, at least in brief, three advanced techniques.

ViewModels are really useful when you have view-related state you want to databind
without polluting your true Model data, when there are calculated values based
on your Model data that your View repeatedly relies on, or when multiple Models
need to be considered when rendering a view.

As with everything in Janus, the default mutators may be augmented or supplanted
entirely by your own implementations.

You can, of course, skip all the convenient structures we've provided and handle
rendering on your own.

And `view.attach(dom)` is a very powerful alternative to `view.artifact()` which
uses the `immediate` parameter we've been passing around without explanation.

View Models
-----------

Janus tends closer to an [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)
philosophy than [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller).
This is apparent from the fact tha we happily allow views to directly manipulate
data, and confluent with how our automatically updating databindings eliminate
a lot of the state management busywork commonly associated with controller code.

Part of this philosophy is that many problems that are annoying to solve with a
Model alone can be made much simpler by injecting a ViewModel in between the View
and the Model. But in Janus, ViewModels are just a convention: they are Models&mdash;no
more and no less.

One example of such a case is when multiple Models relate to a single rendering
problem.

~~~
const Policy = Model.build();
const Person = Model.build();

const PolicyView = DomView.build(
  $('<div><div class="name"/><div class="eligibility"/></div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('name')),
    find('.eligibility').render(from.self()
      .and.app('current_user')
      .all.map((policy, person) => new EligibilityViewModel({ policy, person })))));

const EligibilityViewModel = Model.build();
const EligibilityView = DomView.build(
  $('<div><span class="name"/> <span class="status"/> eligible for benefits.</div>'),
  template(
    find('.name').text(from('person').watch('name')),
    find('.status').text(from('person').watch('age')
      .and('policy').watch('minimum_age')
      .all.map((age, min) => (age >= min) ? 'is' : 'is not'))));

const app = new App();
app.get('views').register(Policy, PolicyView);
app.get('views').register(EligibilityViewModel, EligibilityView);

// say we set this somewhere as a part of logging in:
app.set('current_user', new Person({ name: 'Jane', age: 34 }));

const policy = new Policy({ name: 'Elder Care', minimum_age: 55 });
return app.view(policy);
~~~

So here, `EligibilityViewModel` accomplishes two things:
1. It restructures our data into a form that makes the required computation easy.
2. It gives `.render` something to latch onto when finding the right view, because
   we register the `EligibilityView` against it.

So then all we have to do is instantiate an `EligibilityViewModel` with the needed
data and the computation can happen, and the correct view will be drawn. In general,
you'll find that a _lot_ of problem solving in Janus is accomplished by structuring
the data in a way that makes your computations easy to bind and perform.

And in this case, the fact that `EligibilityViewModel` is purely a convention:
it's just a `Model` that we decided should be considered a View Model because it
doesn't carry any inherent truth about our data.

But we had also mentioned that View Models are useful in single-Model cases for
storing additional view-related state somewhere it can be databound, and for this
Janus provides a little syntactic sugar to make this rote task easier:

~~~
const Person = Model.build();

const PersonViewModel = Model.build(
  attribute('children.show', attribute.Boolean),

  bind('children.count', from('subject').watch('children')
    .flatMap(cs => (cs == null) ? 0 : cs.watchLength()))
);
const PersonView = DomView.build($(`
  <div>
    <div class="name"/>
    <div class="child-count">
      <span class="num"/> <span class="label"/>
    </div>
    <div class="child-show"/>
    <div class="child-list"/>
  </div>`), template(

  find('.name').text(from('subject').watch('name')),

  find('.child-count .num').text(from('children.count')),
  find('.child-count .label').text(from('children.count')
    .map(count => (count === 1) ? 'child' : 'children')),

  find('.child-show')
    .render(from.attribute('children.show'))
      .context('edit')
      .criteria({ style: 'button' })
      .options({ stringify: (x => x ? 'hide' : 'show') })
    .classed('hide', from('children.count').map(count => count === 0)),

  find('.child-list')
    .render(from('subject').watch('children'))
    .classed('hide', from('children.show').map(x => !x))
), { viewModelClass: PersonViewModel });

const app = new App();
stdlib.view.registerWith(app.get('views'));
app.get('views').register(Person, PersonView);

const person = new Person({ name: 'Alice', children: new List([
  new Person({ name: 'Bob', children: new List([ new Person({ name: 'Bobbi' }) ]) }),
  new Person({ name: 'Chelsea' })
]) });

return app.view(person);
~~~

Okay, so a lot is going on here that is a little new. Let's get a few quick ones
out of the way:

* There are some unfamiliar things going on with this `PersonViewModel`:
  * We're declaring an `attribute` on our Model, which helps us declare behavior
    on particular keys on the Model. We then call `.render` on `from.attribute`
    of that key, which apparently gets us a button.
  * We also see a `bind()` call in the Model definition. This one is pretty
    straightforward: that key on the Model will always carry the given computed
    value.
  * We'll get into these things in the [next chapter](/theory/models), on Models.
* Here, as promised, is an example of the `.context` and `.criteria` subchain
  methods on `.render`. They describe to the Library the kind of view we are
  looking for (try removing the `.criteria` line, for example).
  * Again, we will cover this in more depth later.
* We need to render Lists and buttons, so we teach our app about the views available
  in the Standard Library (`stdlib.view.registerWith(library)`).
* We also rely on a common convention in Janus applications, to define a `hide`
  CSS class which applies `display: none !important;` to the element.

But the star of the show here is the extra parameter we've given to our DomView
builder, that `{ viewModelClass: PersonViewModel }` at the end. Notice that we're
still just `register`ing `PersonView` to `Person`, nothing about the View Model
there. And likewise, when we ask our app for a view, we just give it a `Person`,
not a View Model.

Instead, with this `viewModelClass` option we ask `View` to transparently create
a View Model class of the given type. That Model class is then given some context
in the form of plain key/value data attributes: `{ subject, view, options }` where
`subject` is the original intended subject for the view, `view` is the view, and
`options` are `view.options`.

This does mean that whenever we want a property off the real subject Model, we
have to first go through `from('subject')` to, in this case, get the actual `Person`.
But you can see that we can overlay a lot of useful context over the `Person`
with this technique.

We need the child count multiple times, and while we could declare a standalone
`from('children').flatMap(â€¦)` statement and use it twice, it's nice for it to
exist in a structure somewhere, and for it to be computed only once. And, rather
than implement event handlers with internal state to create our hide/show behavior,
we can just use data modeling and Standard Library components to accomplish the
same task, without any messy imperative code at all.

So when you have to combine multiple Models, or compute repeatedly used or complex
multistep values, or add additional view-specific context in order to make your
View a reality, think to yourself how inserting a View Model might help.

Bring Your Own Mutators
-----------------------

With mutators as with every aspect of Janus, we allow you to augment or entirely
replace default behavior. The default set of mutators is exported in the Janus
package as `mutators` and as is often the case you can call `.build()` to create
your own chaining interface:

~~~
const colorize = (data) => (dom, point, immediate = true) =>
  data.all.point(point).react(immediate, color => { dom.css('color', color); });

const myfind = find.build(Object.assign({ colorize }, mutators));

const NameTag = DomView.build($('<div class="name"/>'), template(
  myfind('.name')
    .text(from('name'))
    .colorize(from('color'))));

const dog = new Model({ name: 'Spot', color: 'magenta' });
return new NameTag(dog);
~~~

We use `Object.assign` to merge the usual set of mutators into our own set, which
here is just the `colorize` mutator. Typically, when you have custom mutators like
this, you'd define them in some common utility file that then exports your `find`
function, and this is where you would get `find` from throughout your application
rather than the Janus package.

Custom View Render
------------------

The standard DomView builder structure doesn't work well _every_ rendering task.
This is true of [Lists](https://github.com/clint-tseng/janus-stdlib/blob/master/src/view/list.coffee),
for example, which is why we've solved the problem for you and provided it in the
Standard Library.

High-performance cases or canvas drawing are other examples. Or, as we'll demonstrate
in our sample code here, if your markup is not static per View but you still need
to bind mutators into it.

To address these scenarios, you'll need to learn about one more method override
on `View`s: `_render()`. It will be called when the View is expected to produce
an `artifact`, and it should return whatever object represents that View (typically
a jQuery DOM fragment). It will only ever be called once: the result is cached
as the one canonical artifact of the View.

Let's see an example, which in fact is heavily based on the artifact you are
currently looking at: this very article.

~~~
const Article = Model.build();
const Sample = Model.build();

class ArticleView extends DomView {
  _render() {
    const dom = $(this.subject.get('html'));
    const pointer = this.pointer();
    this._sampleBindings = this.subject.get('samples').map((sample) => {
      const sampleDom = dom.find(`#sample-${sample.get('id')}`);
      return mutators.render(from(sample))(sampleDom, pointer);
    });
    return dom;
  }
  _destroy() {
    if (this._sampleBindings != null)
      for (const binding of this._sampleBindings)
        binding.stop();
  }
}

const SampleView = DomView.build($('<code/>'),
  find('code').text(from('code')));

const app = new App();
app.get('views').register(Article, ArticleView);
app.get('views').register(Sample, SampleView);

const article = new Article({
  html: `
    <div class="article">
      <p>This is an article about a useful subject. Here's an example:</p>
      <div id="sample-1"/>
      <p>But here's a more complicated example:</p>
      <div id="sample-2"/>
    </div>`,
  samples: new List([
    new Sample({ id: 1, code: 'console.log("hello, world!");' }),
    new Sample({ id: 2, code: 'console.log("greetings, universe!");' })
  ])
});

return app.view(article);
~~~

So you see, we can still make use of our various tools to accomplish this task.
We can directly invoke `mutators.render` if we know what it wants, and manually
manage the `Observation` tickets we get back from it by implementing our own
`_destroy` handler.

But you can also see that we take some shortcuts here: we blithely assume that
the `html` on the article will never change, nor will the `samples` List instance.
If these are not safe assumptions to make, then we have a lot more homework to
do to create the same kinds of guarantees Janus normally makes.

It'll be incredibly rare that you have to write a custom view, but when you do
don't forget these things: take only the shortcuts you can, and leverage the same
primitive tools you would normally use with a built `DomView` when you can.

Attaching to Rendered Views
---------------------------

One of the more subtly powerful tools in the Janus toolkit is `view.attach(dom)`.
Attachment is the sole reason you've seen the `immediate` parameter get piped
around this whole time.

`attach` allows you to create a View and attach it to an already-rendered DOM
fragment, rather than generate its own fragment. Mutators will get bound against
the extant fragment, and events will get wired just as usual, but the initial
state of the fragment is assumed to be already up-to-date with the latest model
values, and no mutations will occur until data actually changes.

> After all, if we attached to an existing fragment but then immediately clobbered
> its contents, which would include rerendering child views, there wouldn't be
> much point!

The key use of this functionality is to be able to pick up server-rendered markup
on the client side and resume maintaining it without having to first wipe the
slate clean and re-render everything.

You can perhaps spot how `immediate` fits this task. You will recall (hopefully)
that calling `varying.react(false, (x) => { â€¦ })` will begin running the reaction
callback only on the _next_ value change for the Varying. So by basing all our
mutators on this resolution syntax:

~~~ noexec
(data) => (dom, point, immediate = true) => data.all.point(point).react(immediate, â€¦)
~~~

â€¦which you saw at the top of this article, all that's left is to pass `false`
for `immediate`, and we have a free and easy `view.attach(dom)` method.

> Okay, it's not that easy. The `.render` mutator, in particular, needs to work
> a little bit differently because while it doesn't want to _change_ the rendered
> child view right away it still has to carry the `attach` operation all the way
> down through the view tree.

This does mean, however, that if you have implemented a custom `_render` View
as described in the previous section, you'll have a little more work to do if
you want to use `attach`: you'll have to implement `attach(dom) {}`, which will
need to work exactly like `_render` except it'll have to use the given `dom` rather
than generate its own, and it isn't expected to return anything, and it should
ideally (but optionally) itself pass `immediate = false` as appropriate to any
mutators or `.react`s it performs.

There is more information and sample code about `view.attach` in the [Cookbook](/NYI).

Recap
=====

Mutators, Templates, and Views required a lot of explanation, simply because they
accomplish so much. But they are not, in isolation, complex, nor are they some
monolithic, tightly-bound machine. In fact, we'd encourage you to go [peruse the
actual implementation](https://github.com/clint-tseng/janus/tree/master/src/view);
none of these components are longer than 100 lines of commented code.

To review:

* Mutators take a set of purpose-specific arguments, including data in the form
  of `from` expressions, then a `(dom, point, immediate)` context triplet, and
  return an `Observation` ticket that can cancel the mutation.
  * The default mutators are modeled synactically off of jQuery for familiarity.
  * You can define your own mutators, and incorporate them into `find` using
    `find.build()`, which gives you a new souped-up `find`.
* Templates allow you to `find` targets in a fragment to mutate, and `template`
  just combines multiple `find` operations together.
  * And `template`s can include other `template`s just by inclusion. No inheritance
    needed.
* Views manage the boilerplate and lifecycle around mutators and templates.
  * Each View has a single `subject` that serves as its data context.
  * Upon `destroy()` Views carefully dispose of any computing resources they created.
  * `_wireEvents` can be overriden to apply client-side interactivity; but the
    `.on` mutator is often a simpler shortcut.
  * `_render` can be overriden to skip the normal templating machinery, but care
    must be taken around changing values and resource management.
  * You can call `view.attach(dom)` instead of `view.artifact()` to attach a View
    instance to an already-correct DOM fragment. This can save an initial re-render
    when your application spins back up on the client-side.
* View Models are a powerful tool for restructuring or augmenting pure Model data
  to make view rendering an easier problem to solve.

We're taking huge leaps now that we're past the `Varying`, `case`, and `from` core
facilities. Here we covered all of the templating and view infrastructure, and
in our next article we're going to [talk about Models](/theory/models).
