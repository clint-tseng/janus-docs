Community
=========

It's microscopic. Janus is young.

If and when it grows, more resources and content will come. For now, you can take
a look at [resources](/community/resources) for help and feedback, and our [code
of conduct](/community/code-of-conduct), which we take quite seriously.

If you are feeling up to contributing to Janus, there are some notes [here](/community/contributing).
