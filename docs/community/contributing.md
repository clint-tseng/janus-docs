Contributing to Janus
=====================

We're glad you're interested in helping improve Janus and grow the project!

First and foremost, please be sure you've read our [code of conduct](/community/code-of-conduct).
Once you've done so, you can dive right in, or the section below that best describes
you.

Community Contributors
----------------------

A framework project isn't much good without friendly people to help newcomers up
on their feet. Janus is quite simple once you are used to it, but it can be strange
and alien when you first get started, if you are used to other contemporary frameworks.

Right now, the primary space we have for this sort of question and answer is the
community [Discord](https://discord.gg/NT895JW), but this might change and will
hopefully expand as the project grows.

Code Contributors
-----------------

In general, if you find a bug or you have a solution to an issue that's already
been filed and discussed [on GitHub](https://github.com/issa-tseng/janus/issues),
feel free to dive right in.

If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, we
suggest that you first find or file an issue to discuss it before beginning work.
Janus is _not_ a do-everything framework, and not every feature will be accepted.
It _used_ to be much more expansive than it is today, and over time those structures
and classes have been whittled down to what you see today.

In fact, because Janus is focused on providing a highly useful and immediately
composable set of primitives in the functional ideal, we are generally more likely
to welcome ideas that _reduce_ the footprint rather than increase it, offering
the same functionality through a truer representation of the underlying ideas.

As for the code itself, it is not perfect as it stands today and contributions
will not be judged to that kind of standard. As with all things, the goal is to
improve it continually and incrementally.

Above all, we value the functional purity _of the developer experience_, and
performance where we can win it. Janus adheres to _pragmatic purity_: we do not
hesitate to build stateful internal machines so long as they are sound and they
expose the declarative and functional interfaces you see today.

Please write tests.
